Hello, I am Emily Newell! I started Web Development about 2 years ago when I started managing a website for a small boutique. Since then I have fallen in love with website design and development and taken steps to further develop my skills! In this portfolio you will find school projects, completed tutorials, and my hobbyist projects.
